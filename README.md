# OverclockMe

**OverclockMe** is an open-source, minimalist front-end interface built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Material UI.  
Its goal is to serve as the first step in a broader platform designed for **people with limited time to study**, helping them structure and optimize their learning routines with the help of AI.

## 📌 Purpose

OverclockMe is a prototype login screen for future integration with the **Gemini API**.  
It targets users who:

- Have **tight schedules**
- Struggle with organizing their study time
- Want AI-based assistance to plan efficient routines
- Prefer fast, clean, and distraction-free interfaces

## 💡 Features

- ⏳ Loading spinner feedback with `@mui/material`
